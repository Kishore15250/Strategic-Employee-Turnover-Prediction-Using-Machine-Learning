# Strategic-Employee-Turnover-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning
Employee turnover prediction helps organizations proactively manage their workforce, allowing HR departments to implement strategies to retain valuable employees and address potential issues before they lead to turnover. 
 # Overview
This project focuses on predicting employee turnover using machine learning techniques. Employee turnover, or attrition, is a critical concern for organizations, and predicting which employees are likely to leave can enable proactive measures to retain valuable talent.
 # Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about employees, including features such as job satisfaction, work hours, salary, promotions, and performance metrics. The target variable is whether an employee has left the organization.
# Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. These steps are essential for preparing the data for machine learning models.

 # Model Training
We used a machine learning model (insert model name) for predicting employee turnover. The model was trained on historical data, where the turnover status of employees is known.

# Evaluation
The model was evaluated on a separate dataset to assess its performance. Common evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve, were used.

# Results
The results of the evaluation can be found in the ipynb directory. This includes visualizations and metrics detailing the model's performance.
